#About 'Band Booker'

'Band Booker' is an easy way for bands to create a flyer for an event or for a music lover to dream up his or her perfect gig!

Users are able to input information about their band and upcoming event, including basic details like band name, event date etc.. which generates a simple flyer advertising the event. 

A 'if block helper' is utilized to display flyer templates, which features different background designs and fonts, based on genre selected by user in form.

For example, for the users that select 'rock' as their genre, code for the rock-themed template is what will be triggered and displayed.
